                <h2>An amatuer photographer exploring Finnish nature and culture</h2>
                <h3>Short history</h3>
                <p>Hang Nguyen is a Vietnamese expat living in Finland. 
                    She had lived in her home city, Hanoi, in Vietnam for over 30 years of her life. 
                    She was born in suburban of Hanoi and her family moved to the center of capital 
                    city in her teenage time. She lived there for over 20 years, 
                    graduated her bachelor and master degree in Hanoi National University. 
                    After graduating, she spent one year on working for private company in IT field 
                    but gave up that job and started working as a teacher in Department of Information 
                    Technology,  Hanoi College of Education, now Hanoi Metropolitan University</p>
                <p>After a few years working as a teacher, she started 
                    asking herself about what she wanted in her life, if teaching was really ideal and 
                    suitable job for her or not. In 2010, she got a scholarship of ITEC program 
                    sponsored by India government. She spent 3 months in India and realized that she 
                    could be happy and be herself without caring about othersâ€™ opinions. 
                    After coming back from India, she went travelling quite a lot,  enjoying new 
                    simple things she encountered on the way of travelling.</p>
                <h3>When she starts changing</h3>
                <p>The idea of studying abroad came to her mind 2 years 
                    later, she built her plan from scratch, starting by improving her English and 
                    looking for a study place in Europe, her dream destination. 
                    Finally, she got a study offer from Finland in summer of 2015. 
                    Luckily, her family supported and respected her decision. 
                    She packed her stuff, resigned her stable job and went to Finland in autumn and 
                    started her new life from the beginning.</p> 
                <h3>Photography - her hobbies</h3>
                <p>She has been into photography for long time but only got her first semi-professional camera
                    around 2013, a Canon 450D and she loved it. That camera was tagged along in all her travel journey.
                    In 2015, she upgraded her camera to Canon 60D and also bought some lenses.</p>
                <p>When she came to Finland, she immediately felt in love with Finnish nature and culture. 
                    This blog is an one place where she expresses her love for Finland and also shows off her work.
